# AI-Image-Generation-using-Stable-Diffusion-
This project implements AI-based image generation using the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model. It converts text prompts into realistic images through diffusion-based deep learning. Built with Python, Hugging Face Diffusers, and Gradio, it demonstrates practical application of generative AI research.
